  // change individual pools, and add new templates - but regular users are not able to do so.
  // We set up one pool template for stable-stable token pairs and another for volatile-volatile token pairs.

  /* A pool template consists of:
      PoolIdx: A unique ID which will forever identify pools created using this template
      FeeRate: The fee rate charged on trades, in basis points (1/100th of a percent) - fees are split between LPers and the protocol
      TickSize: The minimum price movement allowed in the pool, in log_2(ticks) - a tick is 1/10000th of a percent and this value
                is actually the exponent so 3 would be 2^3 = 8 ticks. A lower tick size will cause more gas consumption when swapping
                across large price movements, so it's a tradeoff between precision and gas cost.
      JITTime: The amount of time in seconds that a LPer must wait between minting a concentrated position and burning it. This is a 
               means to discourage concentrated position sandwich attacks where one LPer tries to earn all the fees by observing swaps,
               manipulating blocks (possibly via collusion) and sandwiching swaps with a concentrated mint and burn. By not having this
               value set then ambient (full range) LPers will have their rewards diluted by the sandwicher (sandwitch?) while still suffering
               Impermanent Loss. Such a situation would be toxic and lead to poor ambient liquidity in the ecosystem.
      KnockoutBits: Configuration for knockout liquidity, see below
      OracleFlags: Flags for configuring an oracle contract, not used in this deployment. Currently the DEX allows either "permissioned" or
                   "non-permissioned" pools. Permissioned pools require an oracle to be set and the oracle contract will be called to approve or deny
                   actions on permissioned pools including new pool creation, minting, burning, and swapping. All our pools are non-permissioned.

  /* Setting the knockout bits is a bit complicated, from the KnockoutLiq comments:
      The fields are set in the following order from most to least significant bit:
              [8]             [7]            [6][5]          [4][3][2][1]
             Unusued      On-Grid Flag      PlaceType         OrderWidth
                 
      The field types are as follows:
        OrderWidth - The width of new knockout pivots in ticks represented by
                      power of two. 
        PlaceType - Restricts where new knockout pivots can be placed 
                    relative to curve price. Uses the following codes:
              0 - Disabled. No knockout pivots allowed.
              1 - Knockout bids (asks) must be placed with upper (lower) tick
                  below (above) the current curve price.
              2 - Knockout bids (asks) must be placed with lower (upper) tick
                  below (above) the current curve price.

        On-Grid Flag - If set requires that any new knockout range order can only
                      be placed on a tick index that's a multiple of the width. 
                      Can be used to restrict density of knockout orders, beyond 
                      the normal pool tick size.
